### Hi there, I'm Jay 👋

I'm currently working on [Kanka](https://kanka.io/en-US), an online tool that makes building a world for Dungeons and Dragons easier. I started working on it in 2018 as a weekend project, and it has since grown to a fully bootstrapped starterup with several employees. I wear the hats of CTO, tech lead, mentor, project owner, scrum master, customer support, technical writer, and community manager. The most fulfilling part of my job is mentoring junior developers and helping them grow as engineers.

When I'm not busy working, I'm having fun with my family, cooking meals and discovering new craft beers of my home town of **Mérida** in Yucatán, México.

## 🌱 Learning
I'm currently learning the following skills:
* Parenting: As a new dad, I have my hands full in more ways than one 👶
* Cooking: I've recently switched to **stainless steel** cooking and exploring the differences. My most recent success was cooking spare ribs 🐷
* Empathy: I'm always learning on how to be a better mentor and head of a large community 🙏

## 🎮 Gaming
I'm currently exploring the following games, which I play on my Linux desktop:
* Valheim: I die way too often
* Oxygen not included: I restart way too often
* Pillars of Eternity II and Farthest Frontier: next up on my list
